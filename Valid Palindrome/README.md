ðŸ”¹ Problem  

Given a string s, determine if it is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases.  

ðŸ”¹ Approach (Two Pointers â€“ Opposite Ends)  

1. Use two pointers:  

    i starting at the left,  

    j starting at the right.  

2. Skip non-alphanumeric characters with isalnum.  

3. Compare characters in lowercase (tolower).  

    If mismatch â†’ return false.  

4. Move inward (i++, j--).  

5. If the whole string passes, return true.



ðŸ”¹ Complexity  

Time: O(n) â†’ each character checked at most once.  

Space: O(1) â†’ done in-place, no extra string needed.
